# CNN Research

This repository contains the codebase for my CNN architecture benchmarking research.

## Overview
Trained and evaluated multiple convolutional neural networks — **AlexNet**, **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, and **InceptionV3** — on the **CIFAR-10** dataset to compare accuracy, efficiency, and model complexity.

## Contents
- `models/` – CNN architecture defs  
- `data_loader.py` – Handles dataset import and preprocessing  
- `evaluate_models.py` – Runs training and evaluation across architectures  
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies
